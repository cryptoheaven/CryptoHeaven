 * Class Description: Action that does nothing.
 *                    When client cannot recognize the request, it will try
 *                    to encapsulate it in this action... provided that the data set
 *                    will be of valid format, connection will survive, if not
 *                    then client will be thrown off.  Useful to increase compatibility
 *                    between newer and older versions.
