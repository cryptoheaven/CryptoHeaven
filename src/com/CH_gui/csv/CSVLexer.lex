/**
 * Read files in comma separated value format.
 *
 * The use of this class is no longer recommended.	It is now recommended that you use
 * com.Ostermiller.util.CSVParser instead.	That class, has a cleaner API, and methods
 * for returning all the values on a line in a String array.
 *
 * CSV is a file format used as a portable representation of a database.
 * Each line is one entry or record and the fields in a record are separated by commas.
 * Commas may be preceded or followed by arbitrary space and/or tab characters which are
 * ignored.
 * <P>
 * If field includes a comma or a new line, the whole field must be surrounded with double quotes.
 * When the field is in quotes, any quote literals must be escaped by \" Backslash
 * literals must be escaped by \\.	Otherwise a backslash an the character following it
 * will be treated as the following character, ie."\n" is equivelent to "n".  Other escape
 * sequences may be set using the setEscapes() method.	Text that comes after quotes that have
 * been closed but come before the next comma will be ignored.
 * <P>
 * Empty fields are returned as as String of length zero: "".  The following line has four empty
 * fields and two non-empty fields in it.  There is an empty field on each end, and two in the
 * middle.<br>
 * <pre>,second,, ,fifth,</pre>
 * <P>
 * Blank lines are always ignored.	Other lines will be ignored if they start with a
 * comment character as set by the setCommentStart() method.
 * <P>
 * An example of how CVSLexer might be used:
 * <pre>
 * CSVLexer shredder = new CSVLexer(System.in);
 * shredder.setCommentStart("#;!");
 * shredder.setEscapes("nrtf", "\n\r\t\f");
 * String t;
 * while ((t = shredder.getNextToken()) != null) {
 *	   System.out.println("" + shredder.getLineNumber() + " " + t);
 * }
 * </pre>
